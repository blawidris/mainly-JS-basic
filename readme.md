## JavaScript 

Over the years JavaScript has been playing a vital role website development and somewhat popular. It allows implementation of complex features such as just in time content update, animations, 2D/3D graphics, map, etc.

Javascript is a lightweight high-level scripting language that doesn't need to be transformed to different form before browser runs it unlike other programming language (C++/C are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer). With JavaScript being an interpreted programming language, is code runs from top - bottom.

### How does it work

Normally, all programming language source code passes through a program called compiler. Compiler translates source code into a bytecode that the machine understands and can execute but JavaScript has no compilation step. As mentioned earlier, JavaScript is web base (client-side) programming language and doesn't need to be compiled. 

JavaScript works on a client-side machine called web browser, the web browser uses what is known as DOM (Document Object Model) which put together HTMl & CSS to create a web page before javascript engine (called Rendering Engine) converts it to machine language.

**N.B**: JavaScript Engine varies based on browser.

### Why is JavaScript called a client-side scripting language?

It is called so because the browser has to download web pages source file into client browser before execution of the code.

### Who can write JavaScript?

I sure your answer will be for someone who studies computer science. Well your answer is wrong, JavaScript is for everyone.

## Using JavaScript

In this phase, we will be delving into basic JavaScript code and by the end of this phase, you will be able to apply what you have learn to your next project.
